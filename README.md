## Description
This project is about the analysis of data from a dataset concerning fires in Portugal.
## Features
- We will use linear regression techniques to study a given response variable (𝑌) as a function of the other explanatory variables available in the dataset (covariates, 𝑋).
  
- Identification of models best suited to describe Y based on knowledge of linear and generalized regression models, comparison of models found and any other criteria.
